# Copper Industry Sales and Leads Prediction Project

## Problem Statement:

The Copper Industry Sales and Leads Prediction Project addresses challenges in managing sales and pricing data characterized by skewness and noise. Manual predictions within the industry are often time-consuming and may lack accuracy. To overcome these challenges, this project focuses on the development of machine learning models.

## Tools Used:

- **_Python_**: Facilitates versatile programming capabilities.
- **_Pandas and NumPy_**: These libraries will be used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **_Scikit-Learn_**: A powerful machine learning library that includes tools for regression and classification models.
- **_Streamlit_**: A user-friendly library for creating web applications with minimal code, perfect for building an interactive interface for our models.
  

## Steps in the Solution:

### 1. Exploring Data:

- Identify and address skewness and outliers in the dataset.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:

- Transform data into a suitable format.
- Clean and preprocess data, handling missing values.

### 3. Regression Model:

- Utilize machine learning regression to predict the continuous variable 'Selling_Price.'
- Apply advanced techniques like data normalization and feature scaling.

### 4. Classification Model:

- Develop a classification model to predict lead statuses (WON or LOST).

### 5. Streamlit Web App:

- Create an interactive Streamlit web page.
- Input column values to get predicted 'Selling_Price' or lead status (WON/LOST).

## Conclusion:

This project addresses critical challenges in the copper industry by employing machine learning techniques for sales and lead prediction. The developed models enhance decision-making efficiency, providing a robust solution for accurate 'Selling_Price' predictions and lead classification.
